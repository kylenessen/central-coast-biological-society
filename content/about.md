## Our Purpose

**To discuss biology of the Central Coast or items of interest to Central Coast biologists.**

## Our History

The Central Coast Biological Society was started on February 13, 1986, at the PG&E Community Center in San Luis Obispo. What started as a gathering of 40 biology enthusiasts on a "dark and stormy night" has grown into an institution celebrating 40 years of science talks on the Central Coast.

In 1985, during a conference for science teachers at Cal Poly, biologists expressed the need for a professional organization to acquaint them with local biological issues and research, and to provide a forum for communication with colleagues. They felt that although some local groups promoted awareness of environmental issues or had a narrow biological focus, none had a broad scientific perspective.

## Membership

Open to anyone with a professional or paraprofessional interest in biology, including students.

## Our Meetings

We meet three times each year (typically February, April/May, and October) with two speakers per meeting. Each speaker presents for 30 minutes on topics related to a theme. A social period precedes each meeting with refreshments, and there is a 15-minute break between speakers.
