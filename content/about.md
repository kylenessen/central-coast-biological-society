## Our History

The Central Coast Biological Society was born on February 13, 1986, at the PG&E Community Center in San Luis Obispo. What started as a gathering of 40 biology enthusiasts on a "dark and stormy night" has grown into a beloved institution celebrating 40 years of science talks on the Central Coast.

In 1985, during a conference for science teachers at Cal Poly, biologists expressed the need for a professional organization to acquaint them with local biological issues and research, and to provide a forum for communication with colleagues. They felt that although some local groups promoted awareness of environmental issues or had a narrow biological focus, none had a broad scientific perspective.

Gene Elsdon of Atascadero High School responded to the challenge by developing an outline around which our society was organized. A Steering Committee composed of Elsdon, Dave Behrens (PG&E), Harry Fierstine (Cal Poly), Bud Laurent (CA Fish & Game), Ron Ruppert (Cuesta College), and Pete Pedersen (Cuesta College) organized that first meeting.

## Our Purpose

**To discuss biology of the Central Coast or items of interest to Central Coast biologists.** The group avoids political stands.

## Membership

Open to anyone with a professional or paraprofessional interest in biology, including students.

## Our Meetings

We meet three times each year (typically February, April/May, and October) on a Thursday evening with two speakers per meeting. Each speaker presents for 35-40 minutes on topics related to a theme. A social period precedes each meeting with refreshments, and there is a 15-minute break between speakers.

**Attendance is free.**

## Summer Activities

A local field trip followed by a picnic or BBQ is usually planned each summer. Members are encouraged to attend with family and friends.

## A Note of Thanks

Thanks go to Harry Fierstine for writing the history of our organization, and to all the steering committee members past and present who have kept CCBS running for four decades.
