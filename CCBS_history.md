CCBS at 40

Central Coast Biological Society

Thanks go to Harry Fierstine for writing the history of our organization.

History of the Central Coast Biological Society (CCBS)

You're kidding, the forty-year Birthday/Anniversary is here? It seems just a couple of years ago that 40 or so souls braved a "dark and stormy night" to hear talk by Bud Laurent and Dave Sommerville. Admittedly, many of those present that evening are now using "Nice'N Easy" and "Just for Men", but it still doesn't feel like twenty years ago. Who started all this fun?

In 1985, during a conference for science teachers at Cal Poly, biologists expressed the need for a professional organization to acquaint them with local biological issues and research, and to provide a forum for communication with colleagues. They felt that although some local groups promoted awareness of environmental issues or had a narrow biological focus none had a broad scientific perspective.

Gene Elsdon (Atascadero High School) responded to the challenge by developing an outline around which our society was organized. A Steering Committee composed of Elsdon, Dave Behrens (PG&E), Harry Fierstine (Cal Poly), Bud Laurent (CA Fish & Game), Ron Ruppert (Cuesta College) and Pete Pedersen (Cuesta College) organized the initial meeting, February 13, 1986 at the PG& E Community Center. The Central Coast Biological Society (CCBS) was born!

Originally it was thought CCBS could function solely from donations. Pacific Gas and Electric Company furnished the meeting site free-of-charge, Tera Corporation and Kaiser Engineering made a joint contribution of \$100, Pedersen Financial of Morro Bay generously paid mailing expenses for two years, and donations for refreshments were solicited at each meeting. In 1988, the committee required annual dues of \$10 (\$5, students) to help defray increased mailing costs and provide a modest stipend for speakers.

The purpose, criteria for membership, governance of CCBS and meeting structure remain pretty much as originally conceived:

Purpose: To discuss biology of the Central Coast or items of interest to Central

Coast biologists. The group avoids political stands.

Membership: Open to anyone with a professional or paraprofessionals interest in

biology, including students.

Governance: By a steering committee with representation from community colleges

and Cal Poly, K-12 teachers, government organizations and private

industry.

Meetings: Three times each year on a Thursday evening with two speakers per

> meeting (some exceptions), each speaking 35-40 minutes on a theme. A social period precedes each meeting and there is a 15-minute break between speakers. A very short business meeting precedes the first talk. Attendance is free.

Summer: A local field trip followed by a picnic or BBQ is usually planned each

> summer. Members are encouraged to attend with family and friends.

There have been few reasons to vary meeting structure or deviate from the general organizational plan. For each meeting the committee tries to find a local speaker for one topic and an outside speaker for the other, however there have been times when both speakers are local or from the outside. Sometimes the theme that links the two talks cannot be recognized by even the most astute observer! Meetings have seldom been held away from the PG&E Community Center, a couple of times due to scheduling conflicts and once when there was a joint meeting with Friends of the Estuary in Morro Bay.

In an unusual departure from policy, Fierstine represented CCBS in a presentation before the school board of the Lucia Mar School District in support of science teachers who feared the board would adopt a textbook that taught Creationism over one that taught evolution. Evolution won on a 3-2 vote after a very contentious meeting. Once, the society cooked and served a barbecue at PG&E's Bassi House to the Western Association of Vertebrate Paleontologists in exchange for attending their field trips.

The committee recognizes public and environmental health issues as an important part of biology, but has been unable to find someone from the health community to add their expertise to the Steering Committee. In the past, notification of meetings only went to members who may or may not have told others. For a time, meetings were regularly noticed in newspapers and radio to better reach nonmembers, especially new residents of the Central Coast. Currently there is not regular notice going out to the local media.

To avoid having the society run by a favored few, members are encouraged to join the Steering Committee, offer comments for improvement and suggest speakers, topics or activities. The Steering Committee rules by consensus. There is no chairman or president but there is a division of labor among its members. Chapman provides refreshments, Kelly arranges facilities at the PG&E Community Center, Pedersen keeps track of membership and the \$\$, and Ruppert edits and sends out meeting notices and starts the general meetings. The full committee develops the meeting agenda. Over the years speakers have covered a wide range of biological topics from Agriculture to Zoology, DNA to Public Health, Fossils to Recent, Microbes to Whales, and Marine to Terrestrial. (See our list of speakers below.)

The Steering Committee has changed over the years. Behrens, Laurent and Elsdon resigned to pursue other interests, and Roger Zachary (Atascadero High School) Terry Buck (Pacific Beach School) and Danielle DeRome (Mission Preparatory School) had tenures on the committee. Later Dennis Frey (Cal Poly), Ann Morris (St. Joseph's High School), John Jenkins (SLO High School), and Nancy Dalman (Cuesta College) served on the committee. At our 20^th^ year the current committee consists of Jim Kelly (PG&E), Karen Worcester (Regional Water Quality Control Board), Deb Hillyard (CA Fish & Game), Faylla Chapman (Morro Bay High School), Steve Schubert (Camp KEEP), Noah Doughty (Mission High School), Dick Davis (CA Public Health Dept.), Jane Donaldson (Cuesta College), Dave Bowlus (Cuesta College), along with charter members Fierstine, Pedersen and Ruppert. Arline Fierstine is considered an honorary charter member since she served as treasurer and refreshment provider during CCBS's infancy.

The Steering Committee at 20 years consisted of the following people: Dave Bowlus, Faylla Chapman, Dick Davis, Jane Donaldson, Noah Doughty, Harry Fierstine, Arline Fierstine, Deb Hillyard, Jim Kelly, Pete Pedersen, Ron Ruppert, Steve Schubert, Karen Worcester.

On the 30^th^ Anniversary of CCBS, the Steering Committee consisted of the following:

Dave Bowlus, Faylla Chapman, Jason Curtis, Jane Donaldson, Tony Frazier, Courtney Hart, Jim Kelly, Kyle Nessen, Jen Nix, Jennifer O"Leary, Pete Pedersen, Ron Ruppert, Steve Schubert, Emily Taylor, and Karen Worcester (at large). Harry and Arline Fierstine are both honorary charter members.

There was a hiatus of 4 years during the Covid crisis. Feb 2020 was the last session until Feb 2024.

On the 40^th^ Anniversary of CCBS, the Steering Committee consists of the following:

Steve Hendricks (chair), Dave Bowlus, Faylla Chapman, Kyle Nessen, Ron Ruppert, Trevor Ruppert, **(please add)**
